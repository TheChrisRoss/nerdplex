This course teaches .NET programmers what microservices are and how to implement them with NServiceBus.

Letting each service communicate reliably in a distributed application is a real challenge. In this course, Scaling Applications with Microservices and NServiceBus 6, you'll see that it doesn't have to be difficult if you use the NServiceBus framework. 

First, you'll discover distributed applications theory and where microservices and the service bus come in. Next, you'll explore message-based microservice architecture using NServiceBus. Then, you'll learn modeling workflows with NServiceBus sagas. Finally, you'll learn how to use NServiceBus tools to monitor message workflow. By the end of this course, you'll be ready to create a distributed application with messaging using NServiceBus.
