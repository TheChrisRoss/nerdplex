# Prove It: The Art of Mathematical Argument

# Course Description

Course Materials Available on GitHub: https://github.com/TheChrisRoss/nerdplex

Mathematical proof is the gold standard of knowledge. Once a mathematical statement has been proved with a rigorous argument, it counts as true throughout the universe and for all time. Imagine, then, the thrill of being able to prove something in mathematics. The experience is the closest you can get to glimpsing the abstract order behind all things.
