Discover what it takes to be a content strategist: what they do, how do they do it, and why content strategy is so increasingly valued on the web (and a hot job category).

Author Janine Warner shows you how to analyze, prioritize, and think strategically about content in many formats (text, images, videos, animations, and infographics) across many channels. In this course, Janine walks you through a series of decisions to transform an outdated, content-heavy website into a multifaceted, multimedia showcase that includes a blog, email newsletter, and social media profiles. Along the way, explore key content strategy documents and tools, including how to create a content inventory, gap analysis, and content matrix. The course also explains how content strategy often overlaps with information architecture, and how constantly testing your theories is the key to long-term success.
