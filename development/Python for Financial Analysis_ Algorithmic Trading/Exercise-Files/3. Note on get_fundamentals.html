<p><strong>Hi everyone!</strong></p><p><strong>Quantopian has now gotten rid of the get_fundamentals command in favor of using pipelines with morningstar. We actually cover this process later on in the course once we learn about piplines. For now, just skip the get_fundamentals() lecture, we'll show you how to use pipelines for fundamental data later on.</strong></p><p><strong>Thanks!</strong></p><p><strong>Jose</strong></p>
