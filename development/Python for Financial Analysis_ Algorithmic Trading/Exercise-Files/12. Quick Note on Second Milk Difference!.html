<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>Just a quick note on the next video, during the calculation of Second Milk Difference, I call it Milk Second Difference (at the 10:27 mark) I accidentally used an = sign instead of a minus sign! Thus giving me the same result as before, check out the notebook for the correct code, but basically it should have been as I said in the video "minus", when I accidentally typed =. If you take a look at the notebook, you'll see that the second difference is not a big change in adjusting for seasonality and that the first difference was all that was needed.</p><p>Sorry for any confusion and my apologies for the typo, I will try to update this video as soon as I&nbsp;get the chance!</p><p>Jose</p>
