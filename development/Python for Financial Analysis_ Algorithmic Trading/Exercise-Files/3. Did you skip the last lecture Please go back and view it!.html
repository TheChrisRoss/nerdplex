<p><strong>I have one favor to ask of you, if you did not watch the previous course overview lecture, please go back and view the entire video!&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Even if you've taken other courses by me in the past, the course overview lecture has lots of useful information that will save you time looking for things in the course.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Thank you so much for enrolling, and I'm excited to get started, coming up next is a course curriculum, so you can decide where in the course you want to jump into.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Feel free to post any questions to the QA forums!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Thanks!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jose</strong></p>
