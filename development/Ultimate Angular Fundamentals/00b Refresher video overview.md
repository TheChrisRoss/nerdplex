# Refresher video overview

These refresher videos are not part of the "Seed Project", there are simply "watch and learn" videos for a refresher to TypeScript.

Avoid the seed project
Hit an error like this?

Module parse failed: angular-fundamentals-seed/main.ts Unexpected token (35:11)
You may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type.
This is because our Seed Project is expecting an Angular app, not a generic TypeScript app - so don't use the Seed Project for these "TypeScript refresher" videos.

Follow along
If you'd like to follow along with them however, jump across to the official TypeScript Playground to live code in their in-browser text editor.
