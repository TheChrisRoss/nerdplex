# PIMSLEUR SPANISH LEVEL 1 - READING LESSONS

# Course Description

Course Materials Available on GitHub: https://github.com/TheChrisRoss/nerdplex

Reading Lessons begin in Lesson 2 and provide you with an introduction to reading Spanish. These lessons, which total almost 2 hours, are designed to teach you to sound out words with correct pronunciation and accent. The Reading Lessons are also combined at the end of the course.

Learning the sound of each letter alone and in culturally distinct combinations allows your brain to process what you’re hearing in the audio lessons from a new and different perspective. It’s a powerful combination that makes Pimsleur different from every other method on the market.
