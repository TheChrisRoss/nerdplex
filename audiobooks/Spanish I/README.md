Did you know that Spanish is the worldâ€™s second most commonly spoken language? For Americans, itâ€™s one of the easiest to learn, and you wonâ€™t find anything faster or easier than the PimsleurÂ® Method. Even knowing a little bit of Spanish will make travel to Latin America or Spanish-speaking countries a breeze. Whether you want to travel, communicate with friends or colleagues, reconnect with family, or just understand more of whatâ€™s going on in the world, learning Spanish will expand your horizons and immeasurably enrich your life.

The best part is that it doesnâ€™t have to be difficult or take years to master. Thirty minutes a day is all it takes, and we get you speaking right from the first day. Pimsleur courses use a scientifically proven method that puts you in control of your learning. If youâ€™ve tried other language learning programs but found they simply didnâ€™t stick, then you owe it to yourself to give Pimsleur a try.
