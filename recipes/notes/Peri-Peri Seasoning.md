This mixture will keep in the pantry or store cupboard for at least 6
months. So you can make a big batch up and use it throughout the coming
months.

## NOTES

- Depending on how spicy you like your food, you can change the level of
  cayenne pepper. As the recipe is written it is a mild seasoning.
  Increasee the cayenne up to 1 tbsp if you like it spicy.

[^1]: This recipe uses cayenne pepper to get its spice, traditionally this
would have been ground Peri-Peri pepper. Since this is almost impossible
to find I use cayenne as a substitute.
