## DIRECTIONS

WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Recipes for ultimate banana bread abound, but
because they include an overload of bananas for flavor, the bread’s
texture is often soggy. We wanted a moist, not mushy, loaf that tasted
of banana through and through.

To impart lots of banana flavor, we needed to use a generous amount of
bananas, but we needed to rid them of excess moisture. We turned to the
microwave to help us out. We piled as many bananas in a bowl as we dared
and zapped them in the microwave. Then we drained the now-pulpy fruit
and mixed the fruit into a batter. We didn’t want to toss the flavorful
liquid, so we reduced it and added it into the batter as well. Like a
mock extract, our reduction infused the bread with ripe, intensely
fruity banana flavor.

With the flavor problem solved, a few minor tweaks completed the recipe:
We exchanged the granulated sugar for light brown sugar, finding that
the latter’s molasses notes better complemented the bananas. Swapping
out the oil for the nutty richness of butter improved the loaf further.
We also added toasted walnuts to the batter, finding that their crunch
provided a pleasing contrast to the rich, moist crumb. Wondering if the
crust might benefit from a little embellishment, we sliced a banana and
shingled it on top of the batter. A final sprinkle of sugar helped the
banana slices caramelize and gave this deeply flavored loaf an
enticingly crisp, crunchy top.

### STEP 1

- Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 350
  degrees.
- Spray an 8½ by 4½-inch loaf pan with `VEGETABLE OIL SPRAY`.
- Whisk the `FLOUR`, `BAKING SODA`, and `SALT` together in a large bowl.

### STEP 2

- Place 5 of the `BANANAS` in a microwave-safe bowl; cover with plastic
  wrap and cut several steam vents in the plastic with a paring knife.
- Microwave on high power until the `BANANAS` are soft and have released
  their liquid, about 5 minutes.
- Transfer the `BANANAS` to a fine-mesh strainer placed over a medium
  bowl and allow to drain, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes (you
  should have ½ to ¾ cup liquid).

### STEP 3

- Transfer the `LIQUID` to a medium saucepan and cook over medium-high
  heat until reduced to ¼ cup, about 5 minutes.
- Return drained `BANANAS` to bowl. Stir the reduced `LIQUID` into the
  `BANANAS` and mash them with a potato masher until fairly smooth.
- Whisk in the `BUTTER`, `EGGS`, `BROWN SUGAR`, and `VANILLA`.

### STEP 4

- Pour the `BANANA` mixture into the `FLOUR` mixture and stir until just
  combined with some streaks of flour remaining.
- Gently fold in the walnuts (if using).
- Scrape the `BATTER` into the prepared pan.
- Slice the remaining `BANANA` diagonally into ¼-inch-thick slices.
- Following the photo, shingle the `BANANA SLICES` on top of either side
  of the loaf, leaving a 1½-inch-wide space down the center to ensure
  even rise.
- Sprinkle the `GRANULATED SUGAR` evenly over the loaf.

### STEP 5

- Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean, 55 to 75 minutes.
- Cool the bread in the pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes, then remove the loaf from the pan and continue to cool on a wire rack.
- Serve warm or at room temperature.

## FEEDBACK

## INSPIRATION [RECIPE ADAPTED FROM]


[^1]: Be sure to use very ripe, heavily speckled (or even black) bananas
in this recipe. This recipe can be made using five thawed frozen
bananas; since they release a lot of liquid naturally, they can bypass
the microwaving in step 2 and go directly into the fine-mesh strainer.
Do not use a thawed frozen banana in step 4; it will be too soft to
slice. Instead, simply sprinkle the top of the loaf with sugar. The test
kitchen’s preferred loaf pan measures 8½ by 4½ inches; if you use a 9 by
5-inch loaf pan, start checking for doneness 5 minutes earlier than
advised in the recipe. The texture is best when the loaf is eaten fresh,
but it can be cooled completely and stored, covered tightly with plastic
wrap, for up to 3 days.
