## DIRECTIONS

### STEP 1

- Place a large 8-quart stock pot over medium-high heat.
- Add the oil and place the `ONION`, `GARLIC`, `CARROT`, and `GINGER` in the
  pot.
- Sear the `VEGGIES` on all sides to caramelize, making sure not to burn
  the garlic.

### STEP 2

- Pour in the `VEGITABLE BROTH`, `BEEF BROTH`, and `WATER`.
- Bring to a boil.
- Lower the heat to a low boil (medium-low) and simmer for at least one
  hour.

### STEP 3

- Remove pot from heat
- Add `MUSHROOMS` and `GREEN ONIONS` and allow soup to cool approx. 5 minutes

### STEP 4

- Use a skimmer to remove the `VEGETABLES` from the broth. 
- `SALT` as needed.

### STEP 5

- To serve: ladle hot broth into bowls and sprinkle chopped SCALLION and
  sliced MUSHROOMS over the top.

## NOTES

In restaurants, this soup is made several days in advance to allow the
flavors to deepen. It’s not only a great leftover; it actually tastes
better on the second day.
