## DIRECTIONS

### STEP 1

Hardboil 3 eggs (12 minute boil). Cool with running water and
refridgerate until chilled through.

### STEP 2

Drain the `TUNA` thoroughly in a colander or fine mesh
strainer; donâ€™t just tip the water out of the can. Use a paper-towel to
press the tuna liquid out from the product. Next, instead of using a
fork, break up the tuna with your fingers for a finer, more even
texture.

### STEP 3

Soften `ONION` with `OLIVE OIL` in microwave for 1m 15s. Add `GARLIC` to
mixture, microwave for an additional 30 seconds to bloom.  Partially cool mixture for about 3-5 minutes and add `LEMON JUICE` and `LIMON ZEST`.

### STEP 4

Combine all ingredients (_SANS_ `EGGS` & `MAYONNAISE`) and let rest for a minimum
of thirty minutes.

### STEP 5

Fold `MAYONNAISE`, `EGGS`, and `TUNA` mixture together and chill for at least 1 hour.

## NOTES

- Try mixing `CURRY POWDER` into mayonnaise before folding into tuna

## FEEDBACK
