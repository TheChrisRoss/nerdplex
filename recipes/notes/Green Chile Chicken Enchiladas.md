# Green Chile Chicken Enchiladas

We love the bright taste of enchiladas verdes. But too often the green chili sauce is watery and lacks good green chile flavor. We wanted to re-create the memorable enchiladas verdes found in good Mexican restaurants: moist, tender chicken and fresh, citrusy flavors wrapped in soft corn tortillas and topped with just the right amount of melted cheese.

The chicken was easy; we poached it in chicken broth enhanced with sautéed onion, garlic, and cumin. The green sauce is based on tomatillos and chiles. Jalapeños and serranos are good for adding heat to a dish, but we wanted a more complex herbal flavor so we opted for poblanos. To get the characteristic char, which Mexican cooks achieve by roasting on a comal, we tossed the chiles and fresh tomatillos with a little oil and ran them under the broiler. Pulsed in a food processor and thinned with a bit of the broth left from poaching the chicken, the tomatillos and chiles formed a well-seasoned, chunky sauce. To enrich the filling, we liked pepper Jack cheese—and sprinkled more on top of the dish. To make the tortillas pliable and easy to roll, we picked up the same technique from our Chicken Enchiladas with Red Chili Sauce: We sprayed them with vegetable oil spray and baked them for a few minutes. The enchiladas required just a brief stint in the oven to heat through and melt the
cheese. 

Garnished with sour cream, scallions, and radishes, these enchiladas may have the authentic restaurant version beat.

## DIRECTIONS

### STEP 1

- Heat 2 teaspoons of the `VEGETABLE OIL` in a medium saucepan over medium heat until shimmering; add the `ONION` and cook, stirring frequently, until golden, 6 to 8 minutes.
- Add 2 teaspoons of the `GARLIC` and the `CUMIN`; cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
- Decrease the heat to low and stir in the `CHICKEN BROTH`.
- Add the `CHICKEN`, cover, and simmer until the thickest part of the `CHICKEN` registers 160 to 165 degrees on an instant-read thermometer, 15 to 20 minutes, flipping the `CHICKEN` halfway through cooking.
- Transfer the `CHICKEN` to a large bowl; place in the refrigerator to cool, about 20 minutes.
- Remove ¼ cup `LIQUID` (and solids?) from the saucepan and set aside; discard the remaining liquid.

### STEP 2

- Adjust the oven racks to the middle and highest positions and heat the broiler.
- Toss the `TOMATILLOS` and `POBLANOS` with the remaining 2 teaspoons `VEGETABLE OIL`; arrange on a rimmed baking sheet lined with foil, with the `POBLANOS` skin side up.
- Broil until the `VEGETABLES` blacken and start to soften, 5 to 10 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through cooking.
- Cool for 10 minutes, then remove the skin from the `POBLANOS` (leave the `TOMATILLO` skins intact).
- Transfer the `TOMATILLOS` and `CHILES` to a food processor.
- Decrease the OVEN TEMPERATURE to 350 degrees.
- Discard the foil from the baking sheet and set the baking sheet aside for warming the tortillas.

### STEP 3

- Add 1 teaspoon of the `SUGAR`, 1 teaspoon `SALT`, the remaining 1 teaspoon `GARLIC`, and the reserved ¼ cup `COOKING LIQUID` to the food processor
  - Pulse until the sauce is somewhat chunky, about 8 pulses.
- Taste the sauce; season with `SALT` and `PEPPER` to taste and adjust tartness by stirring in the remaining `SUGAR`, ½ teaspoon at a time.
- Set the sauce aside (you should have about 3 cups).

### STEP 4

- When the `CHICKEN` is cool, pull into shreds using your hands or two forks, then chop into small bite-size pieces.
- Combine the `CHICKEN` with the `CILANTRO` and 1½ cups of the `CHEESE`
- Season with `SALT` to taste.

### STEP 5

- Smear the bottom of a 13 by 9-inch baking dish with ¾ cup of the `TOMATILLO SAUCE`.
- Place the `TORTILLAS` in a single layer on two baking sheets.
- Spray both sides of the `TORTILLAS` lightly with `VEGETABLE OIL SPRAY`.
- Bake until the `TORTILLAS` are soft and pliable, 2 to 4 minutes.
- Increase the oven temperature to 450 degrees.
- Place the warm `TORTILLAS` on the work surface and spread ⅓ cup of the `CHICKEN/CILANTRO` filling down the center of each tortilla.
- Roll each `TORTILLA` tightly by hand and place in the baking dish, seam side down.
- Pour the remaining `TOMATILLO` sauce over the top of the enchiladas.  Use the back of a spoon to spread the sauce so that it coats the top of each `TORTILLA`.
- Sprinkle with the remaining ½ cup `CHEESE` and cover the baking dish with foil.


### STEP 6

- Bake the `ENCHILADAS` on the middle oven rack until heated through and the `CHEESE` is melted, 15 to 20 minutes.
- Uncover, sprinkle with the `SCALLIONS`, and serve immediately, passing the `RADISHES` and `SOUR CREAM` separately.

[^1]: You can substitute 3 (11-ounce) cans tomatillos, drained and rinsed, for the fresh ones in this recipe. Halve large tomatillos (more than 2 inches in diameter) and place them skin side up for broiling in step 2 to ensure even cooking and charring.

[^2]: If you can’t find poblanos, substitute 4 large jalapeño chiles (with seeds and ribs removed). To increase the spiciness of the sauce, reserve some of the chiles’ ribs and seeds and add them to the food processor in step 3.
